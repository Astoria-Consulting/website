  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>The Craft Guys Trading Company needs a technology solution that will allow them to sell craft beer and other alcoholic beverages to businesses and directly to consumers.</p>
  <p>This will be achieved with a visually minimal ecommerce website, product information management, customer data management, inventory, invoicing, order management, subscriptions, a blog, contact management, supplier relation management with activity tracking, and a wholesale storefront.</p>
  <p>They need these solutions in one user friendly system, using modern technology, with the data stored in a way that can be analyzed. This data will be a key driver of business decisions through relevant dashboards and performance metrics, which are generated automatically. </p>

  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>The entire software solution will be a customized instance of <a href="https://spreecommerce.org/">Spree Ecommerce</a> and will be hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
  <p>Spree is an open source platform for ecommerce that is trusted by many startups up to companies as large as GoDaddy. This solution allows the Craft Guys to store their data in databases, giving them all the benefits of modern technology from speed to analysis. Hosting in the cloud allows incredibly high uptime and automated scaling, so the solution can easily accomodate this fast growing business.</p>
  <p>Adding and editing product data (attributes, images, prices, etc.), is all done through an administration interface. Craft Guys is responsible for maintaining and updating this product data, as it's used to feed the customer facing website.</p>
  
  <h3>Implementation</h3>
  <p> An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and Agile approach will be followed. The MVP will be developed and deployed first, but that doesn't mean the site is live to the public. It means the Craft Guys have access to use the system, give critiques and requests (which are included as part of the initial build), and watch the progress as features are added over time. The site can go live at any point during development, after the MVP is complete. The go-live will not affect development, as the agreed upon features will continue to deploy after the go-live.</p>
  <p>In the table below, all items listed under "Front End" are part of the customer facing ecommerce website and the items listed under "Back End" are part of the Craft Guys internal administration website.</p>
  <p>Here are the options for the inital build and implementation. Any of the features not built in the initial implementation can always be developed and added on later for a fixed fee.</p>

  <h3>Ongoing Service Plans</h3>
  <p>Astoria is your Technology Department. This means we will handle everything that relates to this technology solution. Once the solution is live to the public, a service plan will begin. Hosting the internal administration website as well as the customer facing website, supporting these systems to keep the lights on, managing all technology related administrative tasks, and providing our expertise to tailor the solution to your ever changing business' needs. Here are the options for the ongoing service plans.</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Session</th>
      <th>Imperial</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hosting</td>
      <td><img class="check" src="/img/logo_clean_small.jpg"></td>
      <td><img class="check" src="/img/logo_clean_small.jpg"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Support</td>
      <td><img class="check" src="/img/logo_clean_small.jpg"></td>
      <td><img class="check" src="/img/logo_clean_small.jpg"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Management</td>
      <td><img class="check" src="/img/logo_clean_small.jpg"></td>
      <td><img class="check" src="/img/logo_clean_small.jpg"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Small Feature Requests</td>
      <td></td>
      <td><img class="check" src="/img/logo_clean_small.jpg"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Transaction Fee</td>
      <td class="price">0.5%</td>
      <td class="price">0.25%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Investment</td>
      <td class="price">$800 / Month</td>
      <td class="price">$1,200 / Month</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>With the Imperial Plan, Astoria will develop, test, and implement any feature request we determine to be "small", meaning low in complexity. Because Craft Guys will likely have many small feature requests (ex: change the text size there, or the banner width over there, etc.), this will streamline the whole process and remove the administrative overhead of estimating and invoicing every feature request.</p>
  <p>Regardless of the plan, any feature request higher in complexity will be estimated and a fixed fee along with the solution will be proposed.</p>
  <p>Each month, Craft Guys will pay Astoria the monthly fixed fee and the variable transaction fee, which is a small percentage of sales during that month.</p>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>
  <p>Since revenue depends on a functioning technology solution, time is of the essence here. This is why the Spree Ecommerce template is so valuable. The development time will be spent on customizing this generic solution for the Craft Guys Beverage Distribution needs, not reinventing the wheel. The projected timeline for development, testing, and going live into Production are as follows.</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Projection</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dubbel</td>
      <td>5 Weeks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tripel</td>
      <td>9 Weeks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Quadrupel</td>
      <td>12 Weeks</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Note that due to the iterative nature of this work, any requested changes to the initial build may add time to the projection. Astoria will be very open about informing the Craft Guys when requests will take extra time.</p>
